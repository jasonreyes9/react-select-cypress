          The project has grown way beyond the original use-case to become one
          of the most popular react components: with nearly a million downloads
          per month, statistically over one in seven people installing{' '}
          <Code>react-dom</Code> also install <Code>react-select</Code> ðŸ˜†
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years the API has also grown organically to accommodate a
          huge amount of flexibility and customisation.

          For the last half-year, with several team members from Thinkmill I've
          been working with Atlassian to develop their new UI library Atlaskit.
          We've had the opportunity to do a lot of deep thinking on component
          architecture, and are now turning our attention to Select components,
          which will use <Code>react-select</Code> as their base.
