# Order of focus:

* [ ] Pass more (and consistent?) props and state from Select to Components
* [x] Fix issue with how the mouse hover interacts with keyboard scrolling
* [x] Ability to customise built-in strings
* [ ] Tags mode (Creatable)
* [ ] Make inputValue a controllable prop
* [ ] Make menuIsOpen a controllable prop
* [ ] Render menu always open | as a dropdown | not at all
* [ ] Handle changing of isDisabled prop
* [ ] Virtualisation
* [ ] Documentation
* [ ] * Props
* [ ] * Customisation
* [ ] Upgrade Guide from v1 -> v2
* [ ] Cleanup

---

# Review:

* [ ] Make sure all on{Event} props that make sense are implemented
* [ ] Check old props that may need to be brought forward:
* [ ] * `autoBlur` (was for mobile -- still necessary?)
* [ ] * `autosize` (not sure why this needs to be supported?)
* [ ] * `backspaceToRemoveMessage`
* [ ] * `className` (for container)
* [x] * `clearable`
* [ ] * `clearAllText` / `clearValueText` (can override component?)
* [ ] * `id` (for container) / `inputId`
* [ ] * `onBlurResetsInput` / `onCloseResetsInput` / `onSelectResetsInput`
* [ ] * `onClose` / `onOpen`
* [ ] * `onMenuScrollToBottom`
* [ ] * `openOnClick` / `openOnFocus`
* [ ] * `pageSize`
* [ ] * `required`
* [ ] * `resetValue`
* [ ] * `rtl`
* [ ] * `scrollMenuIntoView`
* [ ] * `searchable` / `searchPromptText`
* [ ] * `tabIndex`

---

# Maybe:

* [ ] Prevent values from being popped, was `option.clearableValue === false`
* [ ] Scroll behaviour: should we detect parent? how do we handle the footer?
* [ ] Scroll behaviour: can we overscroll up to show the group heading?
* [ ] Internal Required State
* [ ] Touch event handling
* [ ] Scroll the menu into view when it opens
* [ ] * handle `touchOutside`?
* [ ] Async w/ pagination
* [ ] Extention point to reorder / change menu options array when it's created

---

# Later:

* [ ] Reordering of Options (drag and drop)

---

# Done:

* [x] Finalise theme and style customisation framework
* [x] Remove `disabledKey`, clean up similar functionality
* [x] Pseudo-focus Options
* [x] Keyboard navigation
* [x] Make `isDisabled` / `isSelected` etc. props
* [x] Scroll to focused option
* [x] Add `autofocus` prop
* [x] Add HTML Form Input
* [x] Async with:
* [x] * promises
* [x] * better loading state and behaviour
