# Maybe:

* [ ] Prevent values from being popped, was `option.clearableValue === false`
* [ ] Scroll behaviour: should we detect parent? how do we handle the footer?
* [ ] Scroll behaviour: can we overscroll up to show the group heading?
* [ ] Internal Required State
* [ ] Touch event handling
* [ ] * handle `touchOutside`?

# Later:

* [ ] Reordering of Options (drag and drop)
